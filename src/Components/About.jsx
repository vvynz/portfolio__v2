      <p>
        Hello and welcome! I began my journey during the Spring of 2021 where one day I discovered an online coding workshops targeted at women. I had completed a couple of coding workshops but felt like there were still gaps in my knowledge. And I decided that I wanted to purse a formal education in web development fulltime at Lighthouse Labs at the beginning of this year. I've recently graduated and am now, looking for my first front-end web developer job. I am hoping I can find a team where I can continue to grow and further my abilities as a web developer.
